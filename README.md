This is a backend for wePark - our free parking finder app. It was built using `PostgreSQL v12` and `Node.JS v18` along with the packeges included in the `package.json` file and `PostGIS v3`. To be able to run this repo all of those packages will need to be installed, it may work on earlier versions of the stated packages but this cannot be guaranteed. To ensure cloning this repo succeeds please make sure that you have at minimum the versions of `PSQL`, `Node`, and `PostGIS` and then run `npm install` to install the required packages.

The current live version of this repo is hosted using Heroku. [Heroku's Guides](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) are very helpful for setting up your own version.

## Available Scripts

There are some scripts within the `package.json` file that will help with setting up the required databases, testing any modifications, and running your own production version.
